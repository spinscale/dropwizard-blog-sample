text: <p>This is a sample application, which shows off some dropwizard features by implementing a small blog. Elasticsearch is used as storage backend. <br />
  In order to understand most of the stuff here you should have read the <a href="http://dropwizard.codahale.com/getting-started/">dropwizard getting started guide</a>, perhaps the 
  <a href="http://dropwizard.codahale.com/manual/">dropwizard manual</a> and have a normal grip on web development - I am not a guru either.</p>
  <h4>Getting it up and running locally</h4>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Clone the github project <code>git clone https://github.com/spinscale/dropwizard-blog-sample</code></li>
  <li>mvn package</li>
  <li><code>java -jar target/dropwizard-blog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code></li>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a> or to <a href="http://localhost:8080/admin">http://localhost:8080/admin</a> with login admin/test123</li>
  <li>In case you want to check out the source, do not forget to run something like <code>mvn eclipse:eclipse</code> to support your IDE</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h4>Technologies used</h4>
  
  <h5>Dropwizard</h5>
  <p>The last java based web framework I immediately liked after reading the documentation was the <a href="http://www.playframework.org">playframework</a>.
  As I am always looking for new stuff, I quite a lot liked the principles of the dropwizard, so I decided to hack up a short demo to check if it is worth to use it in production when possible.
  My first thought was, that it is just for API implementations and has only little use web sites - but it turned out this has worked quite well.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Elasticsearch</h5>
  <p>
  One of the <a href="">coolest open source projects</a> currently available. Elasticsearch provides a neat abstraction layer on top of lucene, which is used
  for storing entries and users as well as querying. You can argue if a lucene index is the correct way of storing blog entries, but this is merely done
  for demo purposes in this case. As it is an indexing tool, we can simply index the whole HTML and let elasticsearch strip of the HTML source and index
  only in the text. You should check the configuration at <code>src/main/resources/elasticsearch-local.yml</code> for more information. Furthermore there is also
  a special mapping for the articles indexed in <code>src/main/resources/elasticsearch-mapping.json</code>.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Twitter Bootstrap</h5>
  <p>
  <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Defacto standard</a> for rapid prototyping for people like me, who do not have a clue about GUI design.
  Not much more to say, except there are themes now, so that not every sites looks like this one.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Handlebars.js, momentjs</h5>
  <p>
  As my main intention of this project was to create a one page layout - while still being able to support search engines and provide search engine friendly links -
  there is basically one page for viewing articles and one page for administrating them. In order to split a little part of, I used handlebars.js for templating.
  In case you never heard of it, check <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebars.js homepage</a> and be inspired by its simplicity. <br />
  The next great library I used was for parsing dates. If you are used to SimpleDateFormat of java, just try out <a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a>, which makes it totally
  simple to parse dates. I also made a date parsing helper for handlebars with this, which you can check in <code>src/main/resources/assets/js/blog.js</code>. 
  </p>
   
  <h5>jQuery</h5>
  <p>
  jQuery is sort of like twitter bootstrap. No need to talk about it. But I used of course some plugins with it - like <a href="http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/">datetimepicker</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/xoxco/jQuery-Tags-Input">tags input</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/macek/jquery-to-json">formToJson serializer</a>
  and <a href="http://www.quaese.de/texte/webdesign/qp_webtemplate1.php">jq tagcloud</a>. Except the tagcloud, all of these are used in the admin interface. 
  </p>
  
  <h4>Application layout</h4>
  <p>
  I decided to take a simple application and package layout, somewhat similar to a playframework application, with a package hierarchy which does not include
  company package names like <code>de.spinscale.whatever.novel.you.want.to.write</code> but rather the simple approach.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Entities</h5>
  <p>
  The <code>models</code> package contains three models, from which two are persisted into the database as they are defined. The <code>Article</code>
  entity contains a slug, which is part of the URL and standard article attributes like title, a creation date, some tags, an author and the content itself. <br />
  The <code>User</code> entity is only used for authentication in the admin area. <br/>
  The <code>Tag</code> is used only for helping to render the tag cloud.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Views</h5>
  <p>
  Even though I do not really like <a href="http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/">FreeMarker</a>, it is still one of the best templating engines available. GSP is a mess, velocity very similar and the only one
  I really like is the groovy-based one included in the playframework.
  As most of the rendering is intended to be done in the client, there is actually no need for lots of views as most communication is done via JSON, where
  you can return standard entities with dropwizard. There is the main page view called <code>ArticlesView.ftl</code>, which includes a list of articles to be
  rendered via FreeMarker. The page includes a <code>header.ftl</code> as well as a <code>footer.ftl</code>, which loads all the javascript. <br />
  The <code>ArticleView.ftl</code> should not be loaded with a javascript enable browser, but is used to render a single article. <br />
  The <code>AdminArticlesView.ftl</code> is rendered only, if you have authenticated correctly at the resource via HTTP basic auth and includes all the
  code to administer the articles.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Daos</h5>
  <p>
  As there is no real ORM and sadly no ActiceRecord Pattern for entities (again here I absolutely like the play framework approach),
  when elasticsearch is used as storage backend, I decided to create some DAO functionality. The daos are not only used for loading and storing entities,
  but rather for serializing and deserializing (which could be sorted into other classes of course, as this is no real DAO functionality) entities from
  and into elasticsearch. De-/Serialzing is used via the builtin json object of the dropwizard <code>AbstractService</code> class. You could argue of course about how
  useful it is to serialize the JSON stream from the client to POJOs just in order to store them in elasticsearch again. But this approach works in our case.
  </p>
  
  <h5>Resources</h5>
  <ul>
  <li><code>RootResource</code> on <code>/</code>:&nbsp;Renders the starting page which shows the most up-to-date articles and returns an <code>ArticlesView</code>
  This means you could also get JSON data by simply adding the header field <code>Accept:&nbsp;application/json</code> - which is indeed a very nice feature of any class
  extending from <code>View</code></li>
  <li><code>AdminResource</code> on <code>/admin</code>:&nbsp;The admin interface. Allows you to edit, delete or create new posts. Needs HTTP basic auth and an
  existing user in order to work.</li>
  <li><code>SlugResource</code> on <code>/article/{slug}</code>:&nbsp;As the name says, this resource allows you to access articles via its slug. Getting and deleting articles is possible.
  Deleting needs authentication of course.</li>
  <li><code>ArticleResource</code> on <code>/article</code>:&nbsp;Allows you to store new articles and thus needs authentication as well.</li>
  <li><code>SearchResource</code> on <code>/search</code>:&nbsp;Returns a list of articles via search. again via an <code>ArticleView</code>. Search in the slug and text. Should possibly 
  also search in the tags. Might be a try for you to implement.</li>
  <li><code>TagResource</code> on <code>/tags</code>:&nbsp;Returns the content needed to display the tag cloud and simply does a facetting query on the tags field of all
  currently active articles.</li>
  <li><code>TagSearchResource</code> on <code>/tags/{tag}</code>:&nbsp;This is needed in order to filter by tag, when a tag on the tagcloud has been clicked finally.</li>
  <li><code>FeedResource</code> on <code>/feed/{type}.xml</code>:&nbsp;A blog without feeds would not be imaginable, so this one uses the ROME library to create ATOM, RSS1 and RSS2.0 feeds.
  Also it streams the output to the client instead if writing it all at once.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5>Authentication</h5>
  <p>
  I wrote an own authenticator to authenticate against elasticsearch. The <code>ElasticSearchAuthenticator</code> uses the <code>userDao</code> to access users in the elasticsearch
  storage. Passwords are stored in cleartext as this is a PoC. 
  </p>
  
  <h5>Javascript</h5>
  <p>
  The whole logic of the application is put into <code>blog.js</code>. It yields the code of the start page as well as the admin code page - which would usually be plain wrong.
  This script holds most of the logic for the one-page-layout. It adds lots of click handlers to prevent page reloads, loads the tag cloud after page load, executes searches and 
  provides the functionality for the admin mode.  
  </p>
  
  <h4>One Page Layout</h4>
  <p>I decided to try out a one page layout which does not need a browser reload in case you click on an article, a tag cloud or enter something in the search form.
  If this would be a bigger application, you possibly would split your application in some widgets, which in turn would query arbitrary data sources. The
  <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojox/widget/Portlet.html">Dojox Portlet</a> is a pretty nice example of how to do this.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Search</h4>
  <p>As elasticsearch is powered by Lucene in its core, searching is of course its specialty. I only implemented a very rudimentary search, when a term is
  entered in the search box. The search is performed in the slug and in the text, but could possibly also be done in the tags  - whatever you want. If you
  take a look at <code>src/main/resources/elasticsearch-local.yml</code> and <code>src/main/resources/elasticsearch-mapping.json</code> in order to see the
  elasticsearch configuration. Searches are always done with a date filter, which filters articles with a date in the future.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Tag cloud</h4>
  <p>The tag cloud uses a special search functionality in elasticsearch, namely a facetted search, which aggregates information of all currently active articles
  and sums the every tag and its count. It then is rendered by the tag resource.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Admin backend</h4>
  <p>I could have implemented some login and cookie based solution, but I decided to stick with HTTP basic auth and the use of the <code>ElasticSearchAuthenticator</code>
  in order to authenticate users. The admin backend is available at <a href="http://localhost:8080/admin">/admin</a> and allows you do create, delete (+ confirmation) and
  exchange posts. Here I also used most of the jquery plugins like tag editor and the date picker.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Testing with FluentLenium</h4>
  <p>
  I created one standard resource test under <code>SlugResourceTest</code>, which needed some manually tweaking because the <code>ArticleView</code> wraps the article
  JSON data into another <code>article :&nbsp;{ $restOfArticle }</code> form. The other test has been implemented using <a href="https://github.com/FluentLenium/FluentLenium">FluentLenium</a>,
  a nice addon on top of selenium, which is like <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a>, but in pure Java instead of Groovy.<br />
  A big disadvantage of running the test is that I need a started dropwizard application. In this sample the application is started via a thread in the background, then I wait 10 seconds for
  startup and run the selenium tests (which also need a browser so it does not work with CI integration like a command line based hudson). This is not ideal,  so if you know a better solution,
  let me know.
  </p>
  
  <h4>TODO</h4>
  <p>
  There are tons of little features I would like to implement before this is complete (even complete as for a prototype). Keep in mind that it should merely serve as a prototype
  application and not a fully fledged solution.<br />
  If you have a nice idea how to simply fix to run the selenium tests only in the maven integration phase, please mail it to me. I am going crazy with all these plugins and its <code>mvn
  integration-test</code> phase screw up.<br />
  Oh, and put up some more documentation of course.
